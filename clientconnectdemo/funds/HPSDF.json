Collective Investment Schemes are generally medium to long term investments. The value of participatory interests may go down as well as up. The manager does not provide any guarantee either with respect to the capital or the return of a portfolio. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future performance. CIS’s are traded at ruling prices and can engage in borrowing and scrip lending. Different classes of units apply to these portfolios and are subject to different fees and charges. A schedule of fees and charges and maximum commissions is available on request from the manager. The manager has a right to close portfolios to new investors in order to manage them more efficiently in accordance with their mandates. Forward pricing is used. The manager may borrow up to 10% of the market value of the portfolio to bridge insufficient liquidity. Actual investment performance will differ based on the initial fees applicable, the actual investment date and the date of reinvestment of income. Dealing prices are calculated on a net asset value and auditor’s fees, bank charges and trustee fees are levied against the portfolios. Performance is calculated for the portfolio, as well as that the individual investor performance may differ as a result of initial fees, the actual investment date, the date of reinvestment and dividend withholding tax. Lump sum investment performances are quoted. Income distributions are included in the calculations. Performance numbers and graphs are sourced from MorningStar. NAV to NAV figures have been used. The investment performance is for illustrative purposes only. The investment performance is calculated after taking the actual initial fees and all ongoing fees into account. The reinvestment of income is calculated on the actual amount distributed per participatory interest by using the ex-dividend date NAV price of the applicable class of the portfolio, irrespective of the actual reinvestment date. Risk profile of the fund ranges from low risk to high risk with a low risk potentially associated with lower rewards and a high risk with potentially higher rewards. Foreign securities may be included in the portfolio from time to time and as such may result in the following: potential constraints on liquidity and the repatriation of funds; macroeconomic risks; political risks; foreign exchange risks; tax risks; settlement risks and potential limitations on the availability of market information. One can also obtain additional information on Prime products on the Prime CIS website and all price related queries or information is readily available on request. Fund of funds are portfolios that invests in portfolios of collective investment schemes that levy their own charges, which could result in a higher fee structure for the fund of funds.
